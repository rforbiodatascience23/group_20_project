# Project Overview

## Project Aim

Finding trends in data from Uniprot

We will focus on differences between mouse and human and use logo plots for active sequences

Be aware that all data-analysis result is dependent on what have been reported in uniprot, and do not necessarily reflect real life.

## Cleaning data

-   Edit code to good coding style

-   move EC number to augmentation

-   Remove the setdiff() thing that Jeppe did. its not doing anything

-   Consider what to do with binning_site_pos column

## Augmenting data

-   EC number edit

-   Implement peptide kmer sequence extraction around active sites

-   Consider acidic pH number

## Analysis tracks

### Bar plots

-   Examine columns like "pathway" in bar plots. Do ratio on y-axis and not just counts, to adjust for what is most studied

-   

### Sequence Logo Plots

-   Compare differences between similar protein families

-   Compare differences between Mouse and Human for same protein families

-   Look at EC numbers

-   Transmembrane domains

## Line

See if there is a trend in protein location vs pH dependence

## Jeppe

Bar plots of top 10 pathways counted in mouse vs human
