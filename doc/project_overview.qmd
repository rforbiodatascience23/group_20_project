# Project Overview

## Project Aim

Finding trends in data from Uniprot

We will focus on differences between mouse and human and use logo plots fro active sequences

Be aware that all data-analysis result is dependent on what have been reported in uniprot, and do not necessarily reflect real life.

## Analysis tracks

### Bar plots

-   Examine columns like "pathway" in bar plots. Do ratio on y-axis and not just counts, to adjust for what is most studied

-   

### Sequence Logo Plots

-   Compare differences between similar protein families

-   Compare differences between Mouse and Human for same protein families

-   Look at EIC numbers

-   Transmembrane domains
