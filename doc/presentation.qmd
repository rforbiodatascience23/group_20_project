## Introduction

![](../results/04_descibe_plot1_totalcount.png){width="60%"}

## Materials

-   The entries was very untidy and had to be wrangeled a lot
-   This is a example of one of the original datafiles

```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
untidy <- read_delim(file = "../data/_raw/function_file.tsv.gz", delim = "\t") 

untidy |> 
  sample_n(10) |> 
  relocate(Entry,`Gene Names`, Organism,`Function [CC]`,`Protein names`,`Gene Ontology (molecular function)`, `Subcellular location [CC]`) |>
  kable()
```

## Materials

Swiss-Prot data of all proteins in human and mouse with to following variables/columns:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
data <- read_delim(file = "../data/_raw/function_file.tsv.gz", delim = "\t")
```

```{r}
data |> colnames()
```

## and Methods

Logoplots

Linear modelling

## Results - Length and Mass

-   Preliminary summary statistics of protein length and mass distributions in mice and humans clearly show their similarity as organisms.

## Results - Length and Mass

- Further investigation into the linear relatioship between the length and mass of the the proteins. A difference in the linear model could mean a difference in the sidechans of the amino acids.
